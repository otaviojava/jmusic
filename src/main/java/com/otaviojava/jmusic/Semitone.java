 * A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone,[3] is the smallest musical interval commonly used
 * in Western tonal music,[4] and it is considered the most dissonant[5] when sounded harmonically.
 * It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example,
 * C is adjacent to Câ™¯; the interval between them is a semitone.
