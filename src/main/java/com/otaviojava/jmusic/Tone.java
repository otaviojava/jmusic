/**
 * In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone or a whole step) is a second spanning
 * two semitones. A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff
 * positions. For example, the interval from C to D is a major second,
 * as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions.
 * <p>
 * Diminished, minor and augmented seconds are notated on adjacent staff positions as well,
 * but consist of a different number of semitones (zero, one, and three).
