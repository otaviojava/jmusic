/**
 * Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. The Oxford Companion to Music describes three
 * interrelated uses of the term "music theory". The first is the "rudiments", that are needed to understand music
 * notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars' views on music
 * from antiquity to the present; the third a sub-topic of musicology that "seeks to define processes and general
 * principles in music". The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis "in that it takes as its
 * starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built."
